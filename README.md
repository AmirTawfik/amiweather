This repo is for the code challenge of Andela - Premise Weather App

I used Google Places Autocomplete API (through ready UI by Google) to search for a place
I used Google Maps to show selected location on map

I used OpenWeatherMap API to get weather forecast data, the free version supports only up to 10 days data, so I show only data for 10 days (including today) not 14 days

I used Alamofire for networking

I do not include pods in the repo, so please run pod install first then run project

I also have included a simple demo video
